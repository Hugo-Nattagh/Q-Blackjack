# Blackjack Reinforced

### A Q-Learning Application

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hugo-Nattagh/Q-Blackjack/master/Hal.png)

A little Q-Learning try-out to learn how reinforcement learning works.

For the environment, I used [gym](https://github.com/openai/gym).

The result isn't crazy but still better than random!

#### Files Description

- `qLearnBlackjack.py`: Script that learns to play, then play a few hands
- `bj.py`: Script to play blackjack (nothing to do with reinforcement learning)
